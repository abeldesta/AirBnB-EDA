*By Abel Desta* 

# Introduction

## Data
I found this dataset on kaggle, which was sourced from [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/index.html). The website is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows you to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world. 

The dataset for this project is Airbnb data for New York City and Madrid. Combined it contains 69732 listings within 16 columns.
